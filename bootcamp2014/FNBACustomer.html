<h1>Friday Night Bullet Arena Customer</h1>

<h2>Who do you want to make games for?</h2>

<p>Groups of friends who enjoy playing games together, or people who will become friends through playing this game together.</p>

<p>Competitive gamers who want to outsmart their friends (and establish their manliness/intelligence to their friends?)</p>

<p>Competitive siblings who want to play together and prove themselves to be the most cunning, fastest shooting of the bunch.</p>

<h2>What can you tell us about your ideal customer?</h2>

<p>Age: Middle-school, high-school, college students.</p>

<p>Gender: Male (Competitive stereotype?) </p>

<p>Spending patterns: Cheapo. Likes lots of value from small purchase.</p>

<p>Language: Any. (Speaking English is probably not necessary to play.)</p>

<h2>How does industry segment your customers?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Gamers must have fast reflexes. (Mid-core?)</li>
<li>Game is easy to learn for somebody who knows how to use a controller. (Casuals might be invited to play with mid-core and feel comfortable.)</li>
<li>Gamers who have friends in real life to play with. (ie. Not locked in a basement.)
<ul>
<li>In that aspect, it is casual. One does not need to dedicate their life to the game. (vs. League of Legends, WoW, Smash Bros.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>General market trends?</h2>

<ul>
<li>TowerFall is a must-have local multiplayer on Ouya/PS4.</li>
<li>Mario Kart and Super Mario 3D World are huge for local multiplayer on Wii U.
<ul>
<li>In general, Wii U is biased towards offline play.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Xbox One local multiplayer: Rayman Legends, Super Time Force. (Perhaps this market is lacking?)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the revenue potential of the market? How is that changing over time?</h2>

<p>At this point, the profit is made from the initial purchase. Additional DLC may be useful, but the buyer (in the case of children this is the parent) needs to be convinced that it is a worthwhile investment.</p>

<h2>Who would purchase your game or in-game items?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Parents of younger gamers looking for wholesome experiences to get all the siblings involved.
<ul>
<li>They want to bring the family together.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Students with pocket money looking for something fun to play with friends.</li>
<li>People looking to host LAN parties.
<ul>
<li>The game is easy to pick up, which is good for new players.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Key limits for your business?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exposure</strong>: FruitPoncho does not have an audience (yet.)</li>
<li><strong>Experience</strong>: FruitPoncho does not have any veterans.</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong>: Hard to translate to touch controls. Gameplay maybe too fast-paced for quality online play.</li>
<li><strong>Funding</strong>: FruitPoncho has $0 of funding.</li>
<li><strong>Equipment</strong>: Does not require expensive PC, but largely requires controllers. Assume players own another console (Xbox, Playstation) with controllers that can be plugged in USB. Product might work more naturally on a console, where controllers are already present.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do you validate your assumptions?</h2>

<p>Playtest it everywhere we can.</p>

<h1>Customer Profile: Parents</h1>

<ul>
<li>Want a wholesome game to bring the family (their 3 brothers) together.</li>
