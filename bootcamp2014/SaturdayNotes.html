<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoAOzMTLP5s">Business Model Canvas Explained</a></p>

<h2>Business Haiku</h2>

<p>When you get clouded in the details, come back to the basics of business:</p>

<p>Company -> Customer</p>

<p>Customer -> Company</p>

<p>In terms of the Business Model Canvas:</p>

<p>Company -> Customer = Key Resources -> Customer Segments</p>

<p>Customer -> Company = Customer Segments -> Key Activities</p>

<h2>Tip for figuring out monetization</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>If you have no other intuition from previous experience, consider yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li>(Assuming you are in the target audience) Would you buy your product for a price that would satisfy your production costs?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Consider your audiences and their gaming/money habits.</p>

<ul>
<li>eg. In F2P: High money low time VS Low money high time</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Game Studios</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Work for Hire</strong>: Contract service. Customer is the Publisher.</li>
<li><strong>Games as a Product</strong>: One-time purchase, DLC, Trials, P2P.</li>
<li><strong>Games as a Service</strong>: F2P, Subscription-based, P2P, Ad-supported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Customer Acquisition</h2>

<p>The value of one customer should be more than the cost to acquire them.</p>

<h2>Brenda Gershkovitch Fireside Chat</h2>

<ul>
<li>Gaming business is changing.
<ul>
<li>Try to figure out the future instead of looking at the past. </li>
<li>Try to make new and exciting games. ("Do we really need another baseball game?" - This comes from her experience working on AAA franchises.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Working with publishers will be amazing sometimes and dreadful other times.
<ul>
<li>Self-publishing might be less profitable, but Brenda says it is more fun.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Women are 50% of gamers"
<ul>
<li>But this is mostly in casual. eg. 75% female on Facebook.</li>
<li>Still mostly men on PS4, Steam, etc.</li>
<li>Brenda hoping that casual space women will translate into "core" gamers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Core vs Casual: Defined by gaming culture for gaming culture. Not necessarily useful for business descriptions.</li>
<li>Steven Spielberg: "The next big thing in gaming is romance."
<ul>
<li>This is currently exactly Sillicon Sisters business.</li>
<li>They are connecting on Amazon with people who buy romance novels. (Their games show up in related suggested products.)</li>
<li>This allows reaching brand new audiences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Figure out where people are not building. Figure out where customers are starved.
<ul>
<li>eg. The few initial games on Kindle made bucketloads of money.</li>
<li>Brenda: "Don't make games you want to play. Make games they want to play."</li>
<li>Brenda: "[if] we keep making games for ourselves, the industry is not going to change."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sillicon Sisters: Why are girls not playing games? (Their business is girl games.)
<ul>
<li>Most people think: "girls do not play games."</li>
<li>Thus, little investment in girl games. Thus, most girl games are <em>shit</em>.</li>
<li>Motivation: Brenda wanted games to exist for her daughter.</li>
<li>SS interviewed tween girls.
<ul>
<li>Some like the same games as boys (killing aliens, etc.)</li>
<li>Girls like social games. (eg. Gossip, social intelligence.)</li>
<li>In their experience: Make character that girl gamers sympathize with. (Was not easy. Testing was important.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some studios Brenda has been in felt like a frat house.
<ul>
<li>Wild West is fun and creative, and frat might be fun.</li>
<li>Still, keep it professional and welcoming.</li>
<li>"Frat house" alienates talented people who will make you lots of money.</li>
<li>Brenda: Cleaning up the "frat house" studio and bringing women in was very well received.
<ul>
<li>People had lots of fun, got girlfriends, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Daniel Jacobsen Fireside Chat</h2>

<ul>
<li>Gaslamp: Daniel + Nicholas + David</li>
<li>Started tactial RPG. Found scope to be too large (too many assets.)
<ul>
<li>They had 5 people on the team. People left due to no confidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gave up on tactical RPG, unshelved Dredmor prototype.</li>
<li>Dungeons of Dredmor was not originally fun.
<ul>
<li>The whole game was remade many times. Lots of design trial and error.</li>
<li>Originally supposed to be innovative roguelike.</li>
<li>Innovative design sucked. Tried traditional design.</li>
<li>Traditional design boring. Tried quirky style.</li>
<li>Drew inspiration from board games for combat. Was still missing game elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After working on Dredmor for 3 years, they found 6 months before launch that it was viable.</li>
<li>They had to get friends to playtest because they could not judge the game (they were desensitized.)</li>
<li>They started a development blog to get feedback from people.</li>
<li>Got a few readers from people looking for roguelikes (in the niche.)
<ul>
<li>10ish people were reading their blog. They wondered who they were.</li>
<li>Found threads on roguelike forums talking about Dredmor and interacted with them. Answered their questions, got them engaged.</li>
<li>Lots of success was found in small communities.</li>
<li>A thread on SomethingAwful built a lot of community.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This community of ~1000 people bought the game instantly on Steam, so Dredmor rose to the top sellers instantly.</li>
<li>Famous Youtube reviewers found the game on the top sellers list, reviewed them.</li>
<li>Steam is now less exclusive. Dredmor got on Steam because they "knew a guy who knew a guy".</li>
<li>Try not to just show up on forums to advertise.
<ul>
<li>Get discussions going, then find and join the discussions.</li>
<li>Develop community around your studio. ("Gaslamp Games players for life")</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Communicate with platform (talk to Kongregate, Steam...)
<ul>
<li>Dan phones Valve, asks what they want and help them out. (eg. Using new features of Steam.)</li>
<li>Keep customer interests first, but also value "gatekeeper" interests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bringing a prototype at industry events (eg. GDC):
<ul>
<li>Either have a very complete prototype (attractive because low risk.)</li>
<li>Or have lots of experience so they can have confidence in you.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Positioning Statement</h2>

<p>For $(target customer) who $(statement of need or opportunity), the $(product name) is a $(product category) that $(compelling reason to buy/try). Unlike $(competition), our product $(statement of primary differentiation).</p>

<h2>Channels</h2>

<ul>
<li>Consider statistics on what genres do the best on a given channel. (What are the strongest genres? Weakest genres?)</li>
<li>Beware of channel promises vs reality.
<ul>
<li>As a business, they are trying to sell their channel.</li>
<li>Maintain your own statistics in parallel with theirs to confirm beliefs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a saturated market, need lots of money to fund the awareness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>User Acquisition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cost of acquiring a user should be less than how much money they give you over their lifetime.</li>
<li>Want to <em>optimize the user acquisition cost</em>.</li>
<li>Reduce acquisition costs by finding an opportunity that works naturally.
<ul>
<li>Innovative design, underserved platforms, licensed IP, niche genres.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Why would someone promote your game?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interacting with Customers</h2>

<p>You have worked to get players/customers, now how will you interact with them?</p>

<p>Know top spenders, focus on them. Identify ways to focus on them.</p>
