<h1>Friday Night Bullet Arena Positioning Statement</h1>

<h2>Positioning Statement</h2>

<p>For parents who are looking for wholesome games for their kids to play together, Friday Night Bullet Arena is a fast-paced competitive arcade game for instant fun between friends and siblings. Unlike TowerFall and Starwhal, the product is simpler to understand and manipulate to make it a more accessible experience while also making it have a more general appeal.</p>

<h2>Channel Approach</h2>

<p>Currently difficult, because we need to download an executable.
The game was designed with consoles in mind. Namely, PS4.
Getting the game on PS4 requires some insider connections.
Steam may also be an option (on Greenlight.)</p>

<p>On PS4, the game could be offered for free to users as a weekly freebie for PSN plus members. Sony would be paying us for the rights to give it.</p>

<h2>User Acquisition Strategy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Promotion (If PS4)</li>
<li>Promotion &amp; Word of mouth at conventions? (Booths set up to play.)</li>
<li>Rely on addictive feedback loop and the social experience.</li>
<li>Try to find platforms where local multiplayer is underserved?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Customer Relationship Approach</h2>

<ul>
<li>Keep releasing patches for the games with new maps?</li>
<li>User created map database to build a community?</li>
<li>Start working on Deluxe version of game and build up hype?</li>
</ul>
