<h1>Sunday Notes</h1>

<h2>Jon Kimmich Fireside Chat</h2>

<p>Worked at Microsoft, did a bunch of stuff. Worked at other places too.</p>

<p>To make your product, you need to either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use your own money.</li>
<li>Use OPM (Other Peoples Money)</li>
</ol>

<p>When you use OPM, there will be people who will tell you what to do.</p>

<p>Entertainment tends to be risky, investors are hesitant.</p>

<p>Publishers are good at spending money well. They know what will and wont work. "Smart Money". A good option for starting.</p>

<p>Lots of emphasis on releasing many games to learn what works and what doesnt.</p>

<p>Dont ping pong between different kinds of games. Build up knowledge of how to make a really great game of a specific genre. eg. Bungie is all about FPS games.</p>

<p>Angels are mysterious creatures. You never know where youll find them. Dont bet on them for your business. Opportunistic and unpredictable. </p>

<p>Size of the community starts with <em>matters</em> when you start crowdfunding.
Think: How much do I expect from every person? Therefore, how many people do I need?</p>

<p>Hard to get work done during crowdfunding because it is emotionally draining and requires engagement with the community. (Also, stuff like backer rewards.)</p>

<p>Making games is not the same as raising money. You need someone on your team who is passionate about raising money, or it wont happen.</p>

<h2>Financial Implications</h2>

<ul>
<li>How many impressions do you have?</li>
<li>How many installs per impression?</li>
<li>How many purchases per install?</li>
<li>Average revenue per unit?</li>
<li>Average time played?</li>
</ul>

<p>Be aware of grants. Apparently there exists a very easy interface for grants in BC. Just check boxes and it figurs it out for you.</p>
